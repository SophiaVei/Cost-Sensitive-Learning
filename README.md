# Cost-Sensitive-Learning

This work aims to consolidate the problems of different costs
of misclassification and class asymmetry as well as solutions that
exist in these problems.

Working on the differential cost problem
classification. We are using dataset for risk assessment
of lending and the accompanying cost table of the dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/statlog+(german+credit+data). Three
techniques are applied: One sampling type, one weighting type and one of minimizing the expected cost type. They are combined with the algorithms
Random Forest, Linear SVM and Naive Bayes learning. What we want to see is whether the techniques help the problem and
which ones do better for each learning algorithm and overall.
